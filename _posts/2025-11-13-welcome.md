Welcome! This site has been cleaned of theme demo content and unnecessary build artifacts so it focuses only on relevant academic information.

What changed:

- Removed upstream showcase posts and images.
- Dropped Docker development artifacts for a simpler workflow (use `bundle exec jekyll serve`).
- Kept collections for projects, news, and books.

Future additions will cover research highlights, publications, and ongoing projects.

Stay tuned.
